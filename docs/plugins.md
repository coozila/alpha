## Plugins

⚠️💀 **WARNING** 💀⚠️: Review the code of any plugin you use thoroughly, as plugins can execute any Python code, potentially leading to malicious activities, such as stealing your API keys.

See our [Plugins Repo](https://github.com/coozila/alpha-Plugins) for more info on how to install all the amazing plugins the community has built!

Alternatively, developers can use the [alpha Plugin Template](https://github.com/coozila/alpha-plugin-template) as a starting point for creating your own plugins.
